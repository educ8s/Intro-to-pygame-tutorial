# Get Started in pygame in 20 minutes - Python
Welcome to the easiest introduction to game development with pygame in python. If you're new to pygame, you're in the right place to start your journey. In this video, I will guide you through the installation process of pygame on your Windows computer and we are going to build a simple pygame project from scratch. We'll be using Python with Sublime Text to develop a basic pygame program featuring a keyboard-controlled ball. The entire procedure is very easy and should take no more than 20 minutes.

# How to use this project
